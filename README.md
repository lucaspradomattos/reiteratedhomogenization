# reiteratedhomogenization
Computes effective thermal conductivity for 3D multi-scale composites using the Finite Element Method (FEM). This MATLAB code is the computational kernel for reiterated homogenization, solving the "cell problem" for periodic unit cells. Based on the doctoral thesis by L. P. Mattos.
